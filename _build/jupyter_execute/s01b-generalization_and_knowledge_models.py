# # Generalization
# 
# - We say that our classifier or predictor **fails to generalize** (from training to test cases)
# - Since we have great train performance, this is an example of **overfitting**: we achieve extremely good performance on the train set but it does not say anything about the test set (in fact, it is detrimental)
# - Unlike classical overfitting to independent noise, our dataset was additionally doctored!
# 
# _Generalization is the ability of a pattern recognition system to do well on data that it hasn't seen in the training phase._

# # Structure of a PR dataset
# 
# Train, validate, test!
# 
# (Not that it can help with doctored data...)

# Show kNN errors on training _and_ test (or validation) sets at the same time
# 
# Also: perceptron bias!

# # A good but impractical rule
# 
# - a good rule with compelling intuition
# - alas, to apply it, we need to measure the entire population of snails
# - impractical and largely defeats the purpose
# - if we only measure a subset, then what do we believe when we apply the thing in the real world?
# - we need (domain or otherwise) knowledge about the problem / population
#     - this make prediction possible
# 

# # Modeling knowledge
# 
# (cf. PPA book)
# 
# - Knowledge about the population is what makes prediction without enumeration possible
# - There are different ways to represent "knowledge" (or model populations)
# - In machine learning we model populations by probability distributions
#     - We assume that both the training data and the data we will apply our algorithms to are independent samples from a joint distribution of objects and labels
# 
# 
# - You could simply flip to the next slide but I'd like you to contemplate the meaning of this. This is really a semi-religious assumption which seems to be extremely useful in practice

# # The Dogma
# 
# - We assume that there is some joint probability distribution over patterns and labels, $p_{X, Y}(x, y)$
# - (When all is clear we write simply $p(x, y)$ for simplicity)
# 
# - In a week or two we will talk about supervised learning where the training set $\{ (x_i, y_i) \}_{i = 1}^n$ consists of independent samples from $p(x, y)$, but the true $p$ is unknown 
# - Here we assume that $p$ is knownâ€”even so there are many important questions to answer
# 

# # Prediction from statistical models
# 
# - Let's further formalize the minimum error rule for binary classification
# - PPA: It is convenient both mathematically and conceptually to specify the joint distribution via class-conditional probabilities
# 
# - We assume that $Y$ has _a priori_ probabilities
# 
# $$
#     p_0 = \mathbb{P}[Y = 0] \quad \quad p_1 = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1]
# $$
# 
# - $p_0$ and $p_1$ are proportions of the two classes in the population
#     - if we draw a large number $n$ of samples from $p$ there will be approximatialy $p_0 n$ labels $0$ and $p_1 n$ labels $1$
# - In the snail example we had $p_0 = p_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ ("balanced" classes)
# 

# # Prediction from statistical models (cont'd)
# 
# - The patterns are modeled by a random vector $X$ (jointly distributed with labels $Y$)
# - The meaning of "jointly": the distribution of $X$ depends on whether $Y$ is 0 or 1
# - $\Rightarrow$ there are two different statistical models for the data, one for $Y = 1$ and another for $Y = -1$
# - These statistical models are the conditional probabilities
# 
# 
# $$
#     p(x | Y = 0) \quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad p(x | Y = 1)
# $$
# 
# - Generalization to different kinds of labels is straightforward
# - $p(x | Y = y)$ called _generative models_ or _likelihood functions_
# - the joint probability is then
# 
# $$
#     p(x, y) = p(x | Y = y) p(Y = y)
# $$

# # Example: signal vs noise
# 
# - Suppose that 
#     - when $Y = 0$ we observe $\omega$, where $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$
#     - when $Y = 1$ we observe $\omega + s$ for a deterministic scalar $s$
# - Then
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     p(x \,|\, Y = 0) &= \mathcal{N}(0, 1) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \\
#     p(x \,|\, Y = 1) &= \mathcal{N}(s, 1) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - s)^2}{2}}
# \end{align}
# $$
# - The shift $s$ determines how hard it is to predict $Y$
# - Expand a bit and add a figure

# # Prediction via optimization
# 
# We want to compute _optimal_ predictions, and the way to do it is by _optimization_.
# 
# - a predictor is a rule, a formula, or most generally, an algorithm
# - $\Rightarrow$ the quest for an optimal predictor involves optimization over algorihtms
# - algorithms (or functions) are maps from the set of patterns, $\mathcal{X}$, to the set of labels, $\mathcal{Y}$

# What we did earlier is
# 
# $$
#   \mathcal{A} = \text{the set of algorithms} = \left\{ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if}~ x \leq \eta \\ 1 & \text{if}~ x > \eta \end{cases} \ \bigg| \ \eta \in \mathbb{R} \right \}
# $$
# 

# and the optimization problem was
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
#       \text{find}~f~\in~\mathcal{A} ~\text{which minimizes} ~
#       \mathbb{P}(\text{mistake})
#       &=
#       \mathbb{P}(f(X) = 0 \, |\, Y = 1) \mathbb{P}(Y = 1)
#       +
#       \mathbb{P}(f(X) = 1 \, |\, Y = 0) \mathbb{P}(Y = 0) \\
#       &=
#       \mathbb{P}(X \leq \eta \, |\, Y = 1) \mathbb{P}(Y = 1)
#       +
#       \mathbb{P}(X > \eta \, |\, Y = 1) \mathbb{P}(Y = 0) \\
# \end{align}
# $$ 

# # Our prediction is random
# 
# - We obtain our prediction by applying an function / algorithm $f$ to $X$
# - Recall that $X$ is modeled as a random draw from $p(x) = \int p(x, y) dy$
# - The common notation for an estimate of some quantity is with a hat. We will thus write
# 
# $$
# \hat{Y} \equiv \hat{Y}(X) \equiv f(X)
# $$
# 
# - most commonly we will simply write $\hat{Y}$
# - it is understood that $\hat{Y}$ is an _estimate_ or a _prediction_ calculated from the observed pattern $X$
# - we will often look at binary classification where $\mathcal{Y} = \{0, 1\}$ or $\mathcal{Y} = \{-1, 1\}$
# 

# # Quiz
# 
# - How would $k$-means perform on catness and dogness? Could it be fooled as well?
# - Recall our set of threshold-based clasifiers:
# 
# $$
#   \mathcal{A} = \text{the set of algorithms} = \left\{ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if}~ x \leq \eta \\ 1 & \text{if}~ x > \eta \end{cases} \ \bigg| \ \eta \in \mathbb{R} \right \}
# $$
# - Write down in a similar form the set of all perceptrons that work on 100-dimensional vectors
